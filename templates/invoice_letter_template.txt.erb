Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name -%>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

<%= name -%>'s Toy Order

$100  Monopoly
$100  Batman
$0    Kaleidoscope (out of stock)
$100  Skates
$100  Slinky
$100  Transformers
----
$500  Subtotal
$65   HST
====
$565  Total

Your total comes to $565. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%= name -%>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.

Sincerely,

Guido the Elf,
Collections Department
Santa's Village
